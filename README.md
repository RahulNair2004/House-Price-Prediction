# California House Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices in California using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various housing features, and the model is trained using regression algorithms to provide accurate price predictions.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains key attributes such as:

- Median income
- House age
- Number of rooms
- Number of bedrooms
- Population
- Latitude & Longitude
- Median house value (target variable)

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (scikit-learn, regression models)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for experimentation and visualization)

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook HousePredictionModel.ipynb
   ```

## 🚀 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, feature engineering)
- Model training using regression algorithms
- Performance evaluation with metrics like RMSE and R²

## 📊 Model Performance

The model's performance is evaluated using:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R² Score**

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Try different ML models like Random Forest and XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
- Deploying the model as a web application
